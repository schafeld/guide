## Erratum
(That's a fancy word for 'Yo, I found a bug!')

The test for this chapter apparently is erroneous.
An error is thrown although the submission meets requirements and works fine. In order to pass students have to modify the string inside the title variable.

So if you are getting an error  ```An attempt to go to the profile at this point should redirect to the homepage since we are not logged in``` go to the root route ‘/’ and change ```{title: ‘Hello’, message: ‘Please login’, showLogin: true}``` to ```{title: ‘Home Page’, message: ‘Please login’, showLogin: true}```.
